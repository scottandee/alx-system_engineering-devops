For every additional element, why are you adding it?
Firewalls are needed in the design to filter out all unwanted network traffic. A SSL certificate is needed for a secure connection between the client and the server. The monitoring is needed to monitor each of our servers metrics in case of failure.

What are Firewalls for?
Firewalls are mainly used to filter out unwanted network traffic and allow our desired traffic. Firewalls can either be software or hardware. The software firewalls are usually installed on a host computer while the hardware firewall acts as a gateway between the network and your components. A host firewall is what is implemented in this design

Why is the traffic served over HTTPS?
Traffic is served over HTTPS because data that is shared is passed in an encrypted format unlike HTTP

What is monitoring used for?
Monitoring is a tool used to watch the metrics of our computer/server. This will notify the owner if anything unusual is going on with the server

Server monitoring tools track server activity by streaming event logs, also known as log files, which the server generates automatically.

There are several tools available to help monitor web server QPS, including open source solutions, commercial products, cloud-based solutions, log analysis tools, network monitoring tools, and application performance monitoring tools

Issues with this design
Terminating the SSL at the load balancer can create a SPOF at that point in the case of any form if failure

Having only one SQL server that accept writes is an issue because in the case where there's a lot of traffic that needs to be written, it'll
slow down the speed of response at client ends

Having all the components in the same server makes the information of you client prone to theft. In cases that your webserver is penetrated,
the intruder will have direct access to your database
