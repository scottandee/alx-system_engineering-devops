# 0x19 - Postmortem
A postmortem is an incident report that is usually written just after an infrastucture encountered a problem that caused downtime. Postmortems are usually written in a blame-free manner. This is because pointing fingers causes distrust amongst a team. This distrust can lead one of the team members witholding important information that may help solve future problems faster

## Format for a Postmortem
* **Issue Summary**: summary of issue, time and duration, impact, root cause
* **Timeline**: the timeline for the whole incident
* **Root Cause**: detailed explanation of the event
* **Resolution and Recovery**: actions taken to solve
* **Corrective and preventive measures**: ways to prevent any similar future occurences
